# Latest Launches

An app that is able to fetch the latest 50 launches from the RNLI (Royal National Lifeboat Institution), which is a charity that uses dedicated lifeboats around Great Britain and Ireland to save lives at sea.
I originally wrote this app somewhere between 2020 and 2021 using [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) before I learnt how to use virtual private servers to host websites on the internet. Glitch is an alternative to [Repl.it](https://replit.com) allowing you to create and collaberate and host a project for free online during use.

# Future Ideas
I plan to log all the launches for 2024 and create dedicated pages for stations, the boats and hovercraft they make use of.
